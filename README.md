# API_REST_Assured
In this project, I developed an API testing script using Python and the requests library to perform CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on a RESTful API.

Key Features & Implementation:

GET Request – Retrieves data from the API and validates the response.
POST Request – Sends new data to the API and verifies the response.
PUT Request – Updates existing data and confirms successful modification.
DELETE Request – Removes data and ensures proper status code handling.
